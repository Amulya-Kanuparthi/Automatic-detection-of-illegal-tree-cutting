# Automatic-detection-of-illegal-tree-cutting
This project presents a novel approach to detecting illegal tree cutting in 
forests using acoustic signal analysis. Tree cutting generates distinct noise
patterns that can be captured and analyzed through machine learning
algorithms. By developing a system that monitors these acoustic signals in
real-time, this project aims to provide an automated early warning system
to identify illegal activities in remote forest areas. The proposed solution
utilizes pattern recognition techniques to enhance detection accuracy,
providing a cost-effective and scalable tool for forest conservation efforts.
